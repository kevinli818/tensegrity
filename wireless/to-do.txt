refactor radio protocol to use a generic message struct and message ids/unions to differentiate
between different types of messages.
switch to using static TX and RX buffers over malloc-ing and free-ing memory constantly.
fix concurrency problems when more than 1 slave is connected.
  messages cannot be sent piece by piece. entire message must be sent at once.
    mind the 256 byte limit on messages that the nordic board can send.
  making the above change will most likely allow us to remove the use of spin locks.
